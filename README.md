# Welcome to Jo’s Jungle Jamboree 
## Plot
This is a continuation to the epic story that unfolds between Jo and Dio. In the previous crusade, Jo and Dio were devolved rectangles using their wits to stay alive. Jo thought he defeated Dio, but he was wrong. Due to Dio’s vampric nature, he managed to survive the beatdown that was bestowed upon him by Jo.
